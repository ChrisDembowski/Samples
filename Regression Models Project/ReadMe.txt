This is the submission for Regression Models, part of the Data Science specialization offered by Coursera.



Project description and requirements, as they appeared on course Web site:

ContextYou work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

QuestionTake the mtcars data set and write up an analysis to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses. 
Your report must be:Written as a PDF printout of a compiled (using knitr) R markdown document.Brief. Roughly the equivalent of 2 pages or less for the main text. Supporting figures in an appendix can be included up to 5 total pages including the 2 for the main report. The appendix can only include figures.Include a first paragraph executive summary.


The project was interesting primarily because there was substantial multicollinearity among the predictor variables. Contextual knowledge, in addition to statistical knowledge, was useful for determining which indicator variables were best suited for use.
