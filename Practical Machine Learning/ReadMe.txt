This is the submission for the required project for Practical Machine Learning, part of Courseraâ€™s Data Science Specialization.

Warning: Code takes substantial time to run (days on my laptop). It is recommended to examine results by viewing Practical_Machine_Learning_Project.html.

The Rmarkdown (.Rmd) code differs slightly from the R code in order to save time by loading saved models. The R code MUST be run before the Rmarkdown code so that these models can be created and saved.

The Rmarkdown and html files also include a special case version of the ensemble function that utilizes voting. A more general version is included in the R file.
